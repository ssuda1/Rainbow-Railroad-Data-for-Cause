# Rainbow-Railroad-Data-for-Cause
Rainbow RailRoad is a NPO based in Torotno. Their mission is to fund LGBTQI people to escape from the countries which systematically discriminate or opress them, or even threathen their lives. They use volunteers to create data visualization
for fundraising campaign for ther cause.

I constructed scores to show each countries level of tolerance toward peole with different sexuality and visualized in the form of world map (blue is more tolerent and orange is less tolerent). 

This is the code I worte by Python to construct such scores. file: LGBT law.ipynb
